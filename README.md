Project Overview

This repository contains my first web development project, which is an e-commerce website inspired by Jumia. The project was developed using Bootstrap and CSS to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

The purpose of this project is to practice front-end development concepts such as layout design, responsiveness, and component-based styling. It helped me gain hands-on experience with Bootstrap’s grid system, utility classes, and responsive components.

This project demonstrates my early progress in web development and serves as a foundation for more advanced projects in the future.
